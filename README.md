# Predicting Factor of Safety (FS) for Slope Stability Using Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict and classify the Factor of Safety (FS) in slope stability analysis. It uses a dataset containing both numeric and categorical variables, such as reinforcement type, slope angle, and cohesion.

## Objectives
- Predict FS using regression models
- Classify FS into categories: Stable, Caution, Unstable
- Identify key features influencing FS predictions

## Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Seaborn, Matplotlib

## Key Results
- Random Forest Regression achieved the best RÂ² score for predicting FS
- Classification model reached an accuracy of XX% using Random Forest
- Most influential features: slope angle, cohesion, reinforcement type

## Project Structure
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebook for EDA & model testing
- `src/`: Python scripts for preprocessing & modeling
- `data/`: Dataset
- `results/`: Output plots & metrics
